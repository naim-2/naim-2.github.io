            <p>Hi, I'm Naim Salim, a recent graduate from United States International University - Africa, where I earned my BSc in Applied Computer Technology, graduating magna cum laude. I have a strong passion for developing web and mobile applications, and I enjoy transforming ideas into functional, user-friendly solutions. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my programming skills.</p>
            <p>I am also a great chess player, having competed in the Kenya Premier Chess League for three seasons. I represented Mombasa Chess Academy in 2018 and 2019, and in 2023-2024, I played for USIU-Africa. My competitive spirit has led me to participate in the Kenya National Youth Chess Championship in 2018 and 2019, where I aimed to qualify for the Africa Youth Chess Championship (AYCC). In 2019, I achieved this goal and represented Kenya at the AYCC held in Windhoek, Namibia, where I scored 4 wins, 1 draw, and 4 losses over 9 games, finishing 14th out of 22 players in the Under 18 category. My chess skills have greatly enhanced my analytical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and concentration, contributing to my academic success in Applied Computer Technology.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I enjoy origami, which complements my creativity and attention to detail. As I embark on my professional journey, I am excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore opportunities in software development, where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue growing as a programmer.</p>
